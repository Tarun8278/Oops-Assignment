    "\n",
    "# The balance and account_number are marked as private using the _ prefix. This is not strictly enforced in Python (because Python doesn't have access modifiers like private, protected, and public), but it's a convention that signals to developers that these attributes are intended to be private and should not be accessed directly from outside the class.\n",
    "# Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "# deposit(amount): This method allows you to add money to the account balance. It checks if the deposit amount is positive before updating the balance.\n",
    "# withdraw(amount): This method allows you to withdraw money from the account. It ensures that the withdrawal amount is positive and does not exceed the available balance.\n",
    "# get_balance(): This is a getter method that provides access to the current balance of the account.\n",
    "# get_account_number(): This is a getter method to retrieve the account number, providing controlled access to the private attribute _account_number.\n",
    "# Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The internal state of the object (i.e., the balance and account_number) is kept private, meaning users of the BankAccount class can't directly modify these values. Instead, they interact with the object through public methods like deposit(), withdraw(), and get_balance().\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Deposited 500. New balance is 1500.\n",
    "# Withdrew 200. New balance is 1300.\n",
    "# Account Number: 123456789\n",
    "# Balance: 1300\n",
    "\n",
    "# Benefits of Encapsulation:\n",
    "# Data Protection: By making the balance and account number private, we prevent accidental modification of these values from outside the class. Users are forced to interact with these values only through the provided methods, ensuring that business rules (e.g., no negative deposits) are respected.\n",
    "# Controlled Access: We can easily add validation or logging in the methods (deposit, withdraw) without affecting the external interface of the class.\n",
    "# Flexibility: If we need to change the internal implementation (e.g., change how the balance is stored or computed), we can do so without breaking the code that uses the BankAccount class.\n",
    "# This is a simple but effective example of encapsulation in Python! Let me know if you need further clarification or additional functionality."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# So, when we call d.method(), Python will first look in D, then B, and since B has a method, it will call method() from class B. If class B didnâ€™t have the method, it would look in C, and then A if neither B nor C had the method.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Key Takeaways:\n",
    "# The Diamond Problem arises when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common superclass, leading to ambiguity in method resolution.\n",

    "# Static Method (@staticmethod):\n",
    "# The @staticmethod decorator is used to define a method that belongs to the class, but does not require access to any instance or class-level variables (no self or cls parameters). It's essentially a method that behaves like a function but belongs to the class namespace.\n",
    "# Leap Year Logic:\n",

    "# A year is divisible by 4.\n",
    "# If divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400 to be considered a leap year.\n",
    "# The is_leap_year method returns True if the year is a leap year and False otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How It Works:\n",
    "# The static method is_leap_year can be called on the class itself without needing to instantiate an object of the class. You simply call YearUtils.is_leap_year(year).\n",
    "# The method uses the provided year and checks if it meets the conditions for being a leap year.\n",
    "# It prints whether the year is a leap year or not based on the result.\n",
    "# This implementation is simple and effective for checking leap years, and using a static method is ideal because the check does not depend on the instance state.\n",
